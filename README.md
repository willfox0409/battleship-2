# This is the READ ME !

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this   iteration? 

We made sure we still read through the instructions for Iteration 3, although a 'interaction pattern' was not provided, the project requirements were instrumental in determining what we needed to have a running game. We prioritized readability as a design principle. Interestingly, we could not use TDD in the typical way we are used to, so we built the application code with the 'game-play' in mind as opposed to passing test by test. Once we had the foundation of the Game class, we were able to start running the program to test our code, and modify when necessary.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

We understand the appeal of wanting to move onto Iteration 4, but realize that we would have more to gain by focusing on a solid refactor, and diving into the use of mocks and stubs to write tests for the Game class. This was somehting that we were planning on doing at the end, but ended up prioritizing our user test instead, to make sure that the game functions as we want it to. 

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

Originally, we had planned on more 'driving and navigating', but it just so happened right off the bat, that when we split up different portions of the project, we realized we could experiment with a legitimate 'paired workflow' through Github, pull requests, and the review process. Now, although this was an excellent experience, that process comes with its own challenges, so we did need to put our heads together during Iteration 3 to resolve some more complex bugs in teh code together. Perhaps we split the work flow 50/50 in terms of 'divide and conquer' and 'driver/navigator'.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

We maintained an open line of communication that negated the need for any negatice feeback. Any constructive feedback was shared in the moment when we were driving and navigating together. We used Slack to keep eachother informed over the long break, annd based on the fact that we used the strategy of dividing and conquering, we truly did use the Git Workflow to review eachother's code. Whereas in the past, we played the role of making those comments, this time we really did! We both had a few personal obstacles during the break, but were able to stay on track nonetheless through mutual trust, patience and flexibility.
